Are you wanting to learn to code but unsure where to start? You’ve come to the right place. I’ll walk you through the reasons to learn Python to help you decide if it’s right for you and provide a list of resources to learn the basics, get your environment set up, find projects to get started with and where you can go for help and support through your coding journey.
<br><br>

# **Why learn Python?**

Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for software development, data analysis, machine learning and even web development! If you’re wanting to program robots, follow a career in Data Science or make pretty visualisations, learning python is a good place to start!
<br><br>
If this is your first experience of learning to code then the syntax (the structure of statements) is similar to English, requires fewer lines of code and once you have the basic grasp of the logic, syntax and structure, it can be easily applied to other programming languages.
<br><br>
However, if you are more focused on web or app development, there may be other programming languages out there that you might want to consider instead. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are also great starting points when learning to code. Don’t stop reading just yet though, many of the resources and tips below are relevant to any new developer!

# **Resources**

Depending on your style of learning, there are different types of courses you can follow. There are written tutorials with code examples, short videos with interactive coding problems, live-coding videos or the simple textbook. I’ve included a range of resources in this list so that you can give them a try and decide which learning style works best for you.
<br><br>
## **Learn to Code for free**
<br>
**1. FreeCodeCamp**
<br><br>
[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a dedicated community platform for learning to code. They have courses, tutorials, videos and articles to help you get started and cover many different programming languages. The [courses on their website](http://freecodecamp.org/learn) are mainly focussed on web development and are a great starting point if you want to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript! 
For python, they have put together a [comprehensive guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/best-python-tutorial/) to resources, as well as a [YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw).
<br><br>

**Programming languages:** Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript + more<br>

[HiPy](http://hipy.uk) is an open community of people dedicated to introducing anyone and everyone to coding in Python. They run regular events in Liverpool and have a series of beginner-friendly [notebooks](https://github.com/HiPyLiv/HiPyProject) which you can work through and an [Intro to Python course](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XpiY4CrM1bH521VNWouqx-M52QBa8XQS) covering how to get started. They also have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwx8lBs4yUPBNvyq_VQcwJg) channel and have recently streamed live-coding events that are definitely worth a watch!
<br><br>

**Programming languages:** Python<br>
**Level:** Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced<br>
**Type:** Tutorials, Videos, Events<br>
<br><br>
**3. EdX Courses**
<br><br>
EdX has a range of [python courses](https://www.edx.org/learn/python) available. The courses are free to complete with an option to pay for a certificate. The courses are often run by companies or Universities and you may need to explore to find a course that is the right style for you. I’ve found the courses very hit and miss!
<br><br>
Check out this [Microsoft course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-python-absolute-beginner-2) for an Intro to Python for absolute beginners!
<br><br>

**Programming languages:** Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript + more<br>
**Level:** Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced<br>
**Type:** Courses<br>
<br><br>
**4. Coursera**
<br><br>
Similar to EdX, [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) has a range of different courses available for free, with payment to receive certification.
<br><br>
If you’re looking for an introduction to Machine Learning, I completed [Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course last year and highly recommend checking it out! It provides a broad overview with weekly assignments and questions alongside the course. I really enjoyed the style of teaching and the assignments were interesting and appropriately challenging! My only warning is that the assignments use a programming language called Octave which could sometimes be a little awkward — there is an intro to Octave within the course however if you are new to programming, you might find it a little tricky at times!
<br><br>

**Programming languages:** Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript + more<br>
**Level:** Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced<br>

<br><br>
**5. Kaggle micro-courses**
<br><br>
[Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/) is a data science platform which hosts competitions and data challenges. It also provides micro-courses including an [introduction to python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) alongside a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/kaggledotcom) with live-coding demonstrations including concepts in python and data science. Once you have the basics and with a foundation in Data Science, you can get involved with the community, practice your skills with the playground competitions such as the [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) challenge or explore the [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) for use in your own projects.
<br><br>

**Programming languages:** Python<br>
**Level:** Intermediate, Advanced<br>

**6. W3Schools**
<br><br>
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) is a website for learning web technologies, containing code examples and includes interactive tutorials in Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I often find myself referring back to w3 for documentation and detailed explanations with examples of how to use the function or package.
<br><br>

**Programming languages:** Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript + more<br>
**Level:** Beginner<br>
**Type:** Documentation, Tutorials<br>
<br><br>
**7. Udemy**
<br><br>
[Udemy](http://udemy.com) offers over 100k online courses from a wide range of topics and also in different languages. There is an overwhelming number of python courses from different instructors however you can narrow this down by specifying only free courses and selecting your level and topics you are looking for. I’d recommend learning the basics with the resources above and using Udemy to dive deeper into a specific topic if you are familiar with an instructor and like their teaching style.
> **Note:** Udemy also contains paid courses but they often have a sale on, reducing the price significantly so it’s best to wait for these!
<br><br>

**Programming languages:** Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript + more<br>

If you prefer books, [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) is a great place to get started and the content is also available online. It provides practical examples on how to get started and project examples you can work through at the end of each chapter.
<br><br>

**Programming languages:** Python<br>
**Level:** Beginner, Intermediate<br>
**Type:** Book<br>
<br><br>
**9. Python for Data Science**
<br><br>
If you’ve grasped the basics and are looking to explore Python with data science, [Python for Data Science](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) is a valuable resource and again is available for free online, although also handy to have a copy to pick up off the shelf!
<br><br>

**Programming languages:** Python<br>
**Level:** Intermediate, Advanced<br>
**Type:** Book<br>
<br><br>

## **Paid Resources**

There are also resources that offer subscriptions for their learning platforms
<br><br>
**1. 365DataScience**
<br><br>
[365DataScience](https://365datascience.com/) is a Data Science learning platform with an initial free tier to sample the course material. I’ve not used this resource personally, but they cover a range of topics in data science and have a free tier to give you a taster before you commit to the subscription.
<br><br>

**Programming languages:** Python, SQL<br>
**Level:** Intermediate, Advanced<br>
**Type:** Interactive Tutorials<br>
<br><br>
**2. Learn the basics with Codecademy**
<br><br>
[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) requires a subscription to access the full course content and offers introductory and advanced courses to different programming languages. The content that is free to access has changed significantly over time. Whilst this was my go-to resource when I was first learning Python as I liked the interactive style of the courses, now with the platform, you can be mid-way through a chapter and are unable to progress unless you sign up.

# **Troubleshooting**

One of the hardest parts when learning to code can be trying to work out what to search for when you’re stuck. This does get easier the more you practice! Here are a few common places where you might find the answers you are looking for:
<br><br>

**1. StackOverflow**
<br><br>
When searching for a programming question, the top results are usually from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Stackoverflow is an open community where people can ask questions and other developers try to help. Chances are, the problem you’re having, others have already asked on StackOverflow with possible solutions waiting for you!
<br><br>
**2. DEV.to**
<br><br>
[DEV](https://dev.to/t/python) is a community of software developers getting together to help one another out. The platform supports collaboration and networked learning through articles, tutorials and discussions in addition to podcasts and videos shared by the development community! If you sign up, you too can share your coding journey and the things that you learn with the community and meet other people learning to code too!
<br><br>
**3. Medium**
<br><br>
[Medium](https://medium.com/) has a range of publications dedicated to learning to code. TowardsDataScience has many articles and tutorials on Data Science and Python, BetterProgramming and HackerNoon also have content around programming and you may also find company blogs such as Netflix Technology Blog who share technical articles and tutorials.
<br><br>
**4. Data Science Stack Exchange**
<br><br>
Similar to StackOverflow, [Data Science Stack Exchange](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/) is a forum to ask technical questions, this time specific to Data Science and Machine Learning. When troubleshooting Python questions, this resource often appears in the top search results and is another site where the community may already have the answer you are looking for!
<br><br>
**5. Twitter**
<br><br>
There is a large tech community on Twitter. Many people join [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), committing to tweet every day they code over the course of 100 days, sharing what they’ve been learning and supporting others in their journeys too. If you are stuck, you can also reach out to this community and someone may be able to answer your question or point you to something that could help!
<br><br>
**6. Join a Python community**
<br><br>
There are also global networks that host meetups and code nights all over the world. There are also many meetup groups focused on putting on technical talks, tutorials and events — check out [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) or [Eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com/) for events in your local area. It’s also worth considering online communities and groups with Slack channels, Telegram groups or virtual meetups where you can join to learn, share and network.
<br><br>

# **Installing your Python environment**

You’ve read this far and have a number of resources to get you started, next, let’s get Python set up on your machine!
<br><br>
There are several different options when installing Python depending on which OS you are using and how you’d like to get set up. For new programmers, I’d recommend installing [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) which is quick to get started and available for Windows, MacOS and Linux.
<br><br>

## **Python 2 or Python 3?**
<br>
Support for Python 2 was stopped on January 1st 2020. You may still find software written using Python 2 but I’d recommend installing/upgrading to Python 3 if possible!
<br><br>
## **What is Anaconda?**
<br>
Anaconda is an open-source distribution of Python and R. This means that it installs all the necessary software and packages that you need to get started. 
<br>
It includes:

* the **Python** and **R** programming languages

* pre-installed python **packages**

* **conda**, a python package manager which enables you to easily install and update python packages. You may also see pip mentioned, conda is an alternative to pip.

* **Spyder** is an Integrated Development Environment (or IDE, for short), which includes a text editor — think Microsoft Word but for writing code — in addition to tools for testing, debugging and inspecting your program and many features to making programming easier, including autocomplete!

* *(Optional but recommended) **PyCharm** is an another IDE and you will be prompted on installation whether you’d like to install it alongside Anaconda. I’d recommend doing so! I much prefer PyCharm over Spyder, finding it easier to navigate and get started with.

* **Jupyter Lab/Jupyter Notebooks** also can be installed through the Anaconda Navigator. These allow you to write code alongside text or visualisations and can be useful when presenting projects or going through tutorials.
<br><br>

If you already have a preferred IDE that is not included above, such as Sublime or Visual Studio Code, check out the Anaconda [documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#links-to-ide-documentation) to find out how to select Anaconda Python as your python interpreter within the IDE.
<br><br>

## **Python within your browser**
<br>
You can also access Python within your browser by using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/features/python3) where you can also set up an account if you want to save your code.
<br>

## **Other ways to install Python**
<br>
If you’d prefer not to use Anaconda, you can download and install Python from the [Python Software Foundation](http://python.org). 
If you’re using Linux or MacOS, you may already have Python pre-installed but this may not be Python 3. For further installation options, follow the instructions on [RealPython.com](https://realpython.com/installing-python/).
<br><br>

# **What’s next?**

So you’ve installed python, covered the basics and are feeling ready to get started with a project!

Here is a list of possible projects and challenges to give you some inspiration:
<br><br>
**1. CodeWars**
<br><br>
[CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/collections/basic-python) has a number of coding katas, or challenges, where you can put your python skills to the test and compete to solve problems from beginner to incredibly advanced!
<br><br>
**2. Project Euler**
<br><br>
Feeling like a new challenge? Why not attempt the first 100 [Project Euler](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/) problems using python. You can follow [#ProjectEuler100](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ProjectEuler100) on Twitter and join the community to solve the challenges! I started the challenge at the start of 2020 with the aim to complete all 100 by the end of the year… entering the 5th month of the year, I’m way behind target!
<br><br>
**3. Get started with a project**
<br><br>
Check out [Medium](https://medium.com/) and [DEV.to](http://dev.to/) for tutorials you can follow to get started on your first project, or if you are looking to get started with a Data Science challenge, check out the [Titanic Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) challenge on Kaggle.
<br><br>
Watch this space for my next articles where I will walk through a project, exploring datasets, creating visualisations and providing you with the skills and tools to continue your coding journey.
