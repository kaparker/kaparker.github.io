description: Reflections on self-isolating including resources and tips on working from home, managing your mental health and helping within your community during the coronavirus outbreak.
---

Since returning from a trip to Vietnam 11 days ago, we decided to self-isolate as a precautionary measure - this was before lockdown had been put into place in the UK. Fortunately, both my partner and I are able to work from home and prior to our trip had expected to self-isolate for 14 days upon return so were *fairly* prepared.

<br>
Starting back at work this week and with the introduction of the lockdown on Monday, we have had to quickly adjust to this new lifestyle. I've put together a list of a few reflections and resources that have helped me through the first week. 
<br><br>


**1. Establish a new routine**
<br><br>
My morning alarm goes off as usual (well, slightly later) and I start my day with a few new habits; daily journaling & setting intentions, around 30mins of learning and meditation followed by morning exercise. I also am getting dressed to avoid working in pyjamas and ensure I am ready for any video calls. 

<br>
During the workday I've been trying to ensure I get up and move from my workspace regularly to stretch, take a deep breath and give my eyes a break from the screen for 2 minutes and at the end of the day I've been ensuring the flat is clean and tidy so the next morning I don't have to do any extra cleaning before starting work. 
<br><br>

**2. Use a shutdown ritual to start and end your day**
<br><br>
After recently reading Cal Newport's Deep Work - he mentions the importance of having a shutdown ritual to end your workday. Well, why not start with one too? I recently bought an indoor cycle trainer so have been starting and finishing my workday with a 'commute' to allow me to transition between working and relaxing whilst at home. 

<br>
Cycling twice a day within the same four walls has got boring *very* quickly so next week I plan to mix it up and start each day with a cycle then end with a home workout or yoga to clear my mind and keep active. 

<br>
Other ways you can start/finish your workday: read a book, listen to a podcast or even something as simple as decluttering your inbox, making a to-do list and setting up/tidying away your workspace.
<br><br>

**3. Check-in with people**
<br><br>
Set up some virtual catch-ups with friends, loved ones and neighbours or volunteer to provide help with deliveries or to talk with vulnerable people who need extra support at this time.*

<br>
Useful tech for video calls include: WhatApp or Facebook, FaceTime (for Apple users), Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams, or why not try the HouseParty app and play some games?
<br><br>

**4. Take care of yourself**
<br><br>
The most important point here is to take care of yourself. Use this time to do things you enjoy, learn a new skill and remember to be kind to yourself. 

<br>
I've found the following resources relating to mental health incredibly valuable:
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/mental-health/) have some fantastic tips on remote working and your mental health
-  [Rhitrition's blog](https://rhitrition.com/how-to-deal-with-stress-during-the-covid-19-outbreak/) is full of evidence-based research and practical tips to manage your stress

<br>
Please reach out for help if you are having a tough time. The following links contain further tools, support and advice:
- [Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/coronavirus-and-your-wellbeing/#collapse68a5d) provides information to help you cope during coronavirus
- [Samaritans](https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/support-and-information/if-youre-having-difficult-time/if-youre-worried-about-your-mental-health-during-coronavirus-outbreak/) have support and information if you're worried about your mental health during this time 
- [Calm](https://www.calm.com/blog/take-a-deep-breath) have shared some free resources to use during this time to tend to our mental and emotional wellbeing. If you've got the app, Lavender Fields narrated by Stephen Fry is a solid choice if you're having trouble sleeping!


<br><br>
I hope if you too are able to work and stay at home that you are doing so and that these resources can help you through this time.
<br><br>
To all the key workers out there, including the NHS workers, we appreciate all that you are doing to keep us safe and fight COVID-19. Thank you and take care!
